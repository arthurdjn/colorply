# pyhton-colorply

## Purpose

The aim of colorply is to add multi spectral wavelength informations (NIR, SIV, RED...) to an existing cloud of points. Colorply only treats Mic-Mac oriented images/files.

## Documentation
A more detailed documentation can be found at: http://dias.ensg.eu/Terrain/. The project is saved with the name "Photogramm√©trie multispectrale" and is in french.
As this project was created in only two weeks with friends of mine, we did not had time to translate the report or add a more detailed documentation. However you can contact me on git, I will be pleased to answer your questions.
